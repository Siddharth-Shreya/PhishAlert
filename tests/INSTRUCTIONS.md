# Instructions For Testing

## Run the Scripts

Before running `run_tests.sh`, ensure that you have loaded your virtual environment successfully.

#### Note for Windows users:
To run these scripts you will need a Unix-like shell such as Git Bash (recommended) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Then navigate to the `/tests` directory and make sure the Flask server is running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### To run with executable permissions:
```
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
```

### Or, run directly with your preferred shell without changing permissions:
```
bash run_tests.sh
```
or
```
zsh run_tests.sh
```
